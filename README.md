# Work Day Schedule Planner

## The Goal

Create a work hour scheduler, where you can input things you plan to do and the hours you wish to do them. Schedule is color coded and reacts depending on the hour of the day.
Entries are be saved to local storage!

## What I've Done

Imitated example to the best of my ability. Color coding works appropriately. Local storage works appropriately. 
All elements are created with DOM manipulation and jQuery.

Tried to make the code as short and simple as possible.

## Usage

[Deployed Website](https://arhamilton92.github.io/responsive-portfolio/)

Enter your planned activities into the schedule and hit the button to save them! 
Hour entries that are grey have already passed. The current hour is highlighted in orange, and future hours in green!
